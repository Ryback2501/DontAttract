# DontAttract
A Nintendo Classic Mini like layout for Attract Mode.

It is functional, but still a work in progress.

## Prerequisites
This layout uses extra modules not included in Attract Mode. You can download them from this repository: [WAFAM](https://github.com/Ryback2501/wafam)

The instructions about how to setup the modules are on the [Readme.md](https://github.com/Ryback2501/wafam/blob/master/Readme.md) file of the WAFAM project.
